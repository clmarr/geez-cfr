$CFR from Proto-West-Semitic 

$assumptions: emphatics as simply glottalized. 
$ PWS a as -back +front (for typological reasons: the letter 'a' is [a], which is treated as low front) 
$emphatic fricatives treated as simple fricatives (even if they may have been phonetically affricate in PWS) unless marked with a t/d before (as implore.3MSG.PERF was) in the handout. (< al-Jallad Feb 10 2024).
