$CFR from Proto-West-Semitic 

$assumptions: emphatics as simply glottalized. 
$ PWS a as -back +front (for typological reasons: the letter 'a' is [a], which is treated as low front) 
$emphatic fricatives treated as simple fricatives (even if they may have been phonetically affricate in PWS) unless marked with a t/d before (as implore.3MSG.PERF was) in the handout. (< al-Jallad Feb 10 2024). 
$The handout assigns "ə" the same height as /i/ and /u/ thus making me treat it as [ɨ]. Likewise "ä" is assigned the same height as /e/ and /o/ so I treat it as /ɘ/.

$interdentals assibilated. Shared with Canaanite. But this is also reasonably common. 
[+ant,+cont,-son] > [+strid,-distr]

$p fricated. Shared with Arabic and MSA. But reasonably common.
p > f 

$dz to z and ts to s deaffricated. This is shared with Hebrew. p to f also happens (shared with Arabic and MSA). Unclear if other affricates survive as such. Running these all together.

$before short vowels are centralized, u triggers labialization on prior dorsals consonants
[+back,-son] > [+round,+lab] / __ u

=Pre-Ge'ez

$I separate a Pre-Ge'ez off on the (arbitrary, but elegant-seeming) logic that (a) the vowel centralization delimits at least a few devleopments that should have happened before it into an earlier period than those that happen after, and (b) it's what makes Ge'ez start to sound like the sort of Circassianized Semitic it sounds like :) 


$centralization (and derounding) of short vowels:
	$  /a/ centralizes and raises to /ɘ/
	$ /i/ and /u/ merge to /ɨ/  
	$ thankfully this can be expressed in a single rule!
[+syl,-long] > [-front,-back,-lo,-round,-lab] 

$long vowels shorten
