$CFR from Proto-West-Semitic 

$assumptions: emphatics as simply glottalized. 
$ PWS a as -back +front (for typological reasons: the letter 'a' is [a], which is treated as low front) 
$emphatic fricatives treated as simple fricatives (even if they may have been phonetically affricate in PWS) unless marked with a t/d before (as implore.3MSG.PERF was) in the handout. (< al-Jallad Feb 10 2024). 
$The handout assigns "ə" the same height as /i/ and /u/ thus making me treat it as [ɨ]. Likewise "ä" is assigned the same height as /e/ and /o/ so I treat it as /ɘ/.
$I am treating geminates as consecutive identical consonants, not long consonants, a fact that matters a lot for how we characterize the conditioning of (e.g.) syncope.

$interdentals assibilated. Shared with Canaanite. But this is also reasonably common. 
[+ant,+cont,-son,-lat] > [+strid,-distr]

$p fricated. Shared with Arabic and MSA. But reasonably common.
p > f 

$dz to z and ts to s deaffricated. This is shared with Hebrew. p to f also happens (shared with Arabic and MSA). Unclear if other affricates survive as such. Running these all together.

=Early-Proto-Southwest-Semitic

$before short vowels are centralized, u triggers labialization on prior dorsal and guttural consonants
$ but if there is an /a/ before the cluster, it absorbs the labialization instead, and it does not remain on the cluster. If the /a/ is short, it becomes /u/. If it is long /a:/... well the reflex ends up as /a:/, and that is all we know at this time. 
[-ant,-son] > [+round,+lab,] / {#;[+syl,-lo]} ([-syl])* __ u
a > u / __ ([+cons])* [+cons,-cor,-ant] u


=Pre-Ge'ez

$I separate a Pre-Ge'ez off on the (arbitrary, but elegant-seeming) logic that (a) the vowel centralization delimits at least a few devleopments that should have happened before it into an earlier period than those that happen after, and (b) it's what makes Ge'ez start to sound like the sort of Circassianized Semitic it sounds like :) 


$centralization (and derounding) of short vowels:
	$  /a/ centralizes and raises to /ɘ/
	$ /i/ and /u/ merge to /ɨ/  
	$ thankfully this can be expressed in a single rule!
[+syl,-long] > [-front,-back,-lo,-round,-lab] 


$now that we have ɨ, the weakest vowel, it is subject to syncope and apocope.
$syncope whenever possible. 
ɨ > ∅ / __ #

$apocope of ɨ if the resulting cluster is only two asyllabics (consonant or glide) long. This is feeds ɘ glide coalescence by creating coda-glides (ɬajiba > ɬebɘ; kawuna > konɘ...) 
ɨ > ∅ / [+syl] [-syl] __ [-syl] [+syl]

$ɘ coming into contact with a glide coalesces with it to form a vowel with its same place and roundness. Rule written broadly to boldly predict ɘ + vowel coalescence if possible. However, this must happen AFTER ɨ syncope because it feeds it. This does not happen if the glide could be a syllable onset (maximal onset principle), as seen from t͡sˀallaja > sˀɘllɘjɘ. 
ɘ [+hi,ɑback,βround,ɣfront,ɸlab] > [ɑback,βround,ɣfront,ɸlab] ∅ / __ {#;[-syl]}

$long vowels shorten, except in the case of ʔaɬwaːk, which is hte only pre-stop short vowel
[+syl] > [-long] / __ {#;[+cont]} 

$ɘ lowers back to a under influence of following guttural 
ɘ > a / __ {[+lo,-hi,-son];ʔ}
